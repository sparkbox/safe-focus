## Commit Style
We use [Conventional Commits] and [Standard Version] to automate versioning of this package. Commit messages must be prefixed with a valid commit type and the commit type cannot be prefixed with any additional text.

Supported commit types include `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, and `test`.

Valid example:
```sh
feat: add new linting rule for ...
```

Invalid examples:
```sh
feature: add new linting rule for ...
```

```sh
:sparkles: feat: add new linting rule for ...
```

ℹ️ See the [Conventional Commits] page for further details on available commit types and how to handle breaking changes.

## Creating a Release
When making a change that requires a new version to be published, you'll want to run the release task before merging to master.

```sh
$ npm run release
```

After running this command, you'll get a preview of what the next tagged version would be. If you proceed, the release script will:

- Use all commit messages since the latest version tag to determine the correct new version
- Increment the version in package.json and package-lock.json
- Create a tagged commit with the new version
- Push your branch (and new tag) to the remote

After your branch is merged, CI will take care of publishing to the npm registry.

ℹ️ See the [Standard Version][standard cli] documentation for details on how to control versioning behavior.

### Specifying a release type
Sometimes, you'll want manual control over the next version of the package. In these case, you can use the special `--major`, `--minor`, and `--patch` flags.

Major Release

```sh
npm run release -- --major
```

Minor Release

```sh
npm run release -- --minor
```

Patch Release

```sh
npm run release -- --patch
```
